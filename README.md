FireZone is a simple [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) based VPN server and firewall for Linux designed to be secure, easy to manage, and quick to set up.

![Architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/167144/134593363-870c982d-921b-4f0c-b210-e77c8860d9ca.png)

# What is Firezone?

Firezone can be set up in minutes to manage your WireGuard VPN through a simple web interface.

## Features

- **Simple to setup and use:** We support
    [most major Linux distributions](#supported-operating-systems).
    Most configuration is managed through a snappy Web UI.
- **Fast:** Firezone uses the new
    [WireGuard](https://wireguard.com) VPN protocol to encrypt all VPN traffic,
    making it [3-4x faster than OpenVPN](https://wireguard.com/performance/).
- **Firewall built in:** Block egress traffic from your devices to specific IPs
    and CIDR ranges. Firezone includes a frontend to manage the speedy new
    [netfilter](https://netfilter.org) packet filtering system built into the
    Linux kernel.
- **No dependencies:** Firezone leverages
    [Chef Omnibus](https://github.com/chef/omnibus) to bundle all its
    dependencies into a single distributable package. Only a recent Linux kernel
    (4.19+) and the WireGuard kernel module are required.
- **Secure:** The Firezone Web UI runs as an unpriveleged user. HTTPS is
    required everywhere, and cookies are encrypted.

# Deploying and Configuring

1. Download the relevant package for your distribution from the [releases page](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases)
2. Install with `sudo rpm -i firezone-<version>.rpm` or `sudo dpkg -i firezone-<version>.deb` depending on your distribution. This will unpack the application and set up necessary directory structure.
3. Bootstrap the application with `sudo firezone-ctl reconfigure`. This will initialize config files, set up needed services and generate the default configuration.
4. Edit the default configuration at `/etc/firezone/firezone.rb`. You'll want to make sure `default['firezone']['fqdn']`, `default['firezone']['url_host']`, `default['firezone']['ssl']['certificate']`, and `default['firezone']['ssl']['certificate']` are set properly.
5. Reconfigure the application to pick up the new changes: `sudo firezone-ctl reconfigure`.
6. Finally, create an admin user with `sudo firezone-ctl create_admin`. Check the console for the login credentials.
7. Now you should be able to log into the web UI at `https://<your-server-fqdn>`

# Using Firezone VPN

Your FireZone installation can be managed via the `firezone-ctl` command, as shown below. Most subcommands require prefixing with `sudo`.

```shell

omnibus-ctl: command (subcommand)
create_admin
  Create an Admin user

  help
    Print this help message.
  reconfigure

  show-config
    Show the configuration that would be generated by reconfigure.
  uninstall
    Kill all processes and uninstall the process supervisor (data will be preserved).
  version

## Requirements

FireZone currently supports the following Linux distros:

- CentOS: `7`, `8`
- Ubuntu: `18.04`, `20.04`
- Debian: `10`, `11`
- Fedora: `33`, `34`

If your distro isn't listed here please [open an issue](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/new/choose) and we'll look into adding it.

FireZone requires a valid SSL certificate and a matching DNS record to run in production.

# Architecture

FireZone is written in the Elixir programming language and composed as an [Umbrella
project](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/dependencies-and-umbrella-projects.html)
consisting of three independent applications:

- [apps/fz_http](apps/fz_http): The Web Application
- [apps/fz_wall](apps/fz_wall): Firewall Management Process
- [apps/fz_vpn](apps/fz_vpn): WireGuard™ Management Process

For now, FireZone assumes these apps are all running on the same host.

[Chef Omnibus](https://github.com/chef/omnibus) is used to bundle all FireZone dependencies into a single distributable Linux package.

# Getting Support
For help, feedback or contributions please join our [Slack group](https://admin.typeform.com/form/rpMtkZw4/create?block=a9c11a46-1dcf-4155-b447-0d8ce5700d5f). We're actively working to improve Firezone, and the Slack group is the best way to coordinate our efforts.
