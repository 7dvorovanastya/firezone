# Client Setup and Usage

## Adding Devices
Add a device through the Web UI by clicking the "Add Device" button under `/devices` or `/users`. Once the device profile is created, you can send the WireGuard configuration file to the client.

## Client Instructions
Clients should download the latest version of the WireGuard client from https://www.wireguard.com/install/. Once installed, clients can import the tunnel via the `.conf` file sent by the administrator.
