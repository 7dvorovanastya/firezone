Add a device through the Web UI by clicking the "Add Device" button under
`/devices` or `/users`.

Once the device profile is created, you can send the WireGuard configuration file
to the user by:

* **Shareable Link**: Generates a time limited link to the device config file
  that can be sent to the user.
* **Download Config**: Downloads the device config file to your local machine
  to be sent securely to the user.

Devices are associated with users. See [Add Users
](/docs/user-guides/add-users.md) for more information on how to add a user.
