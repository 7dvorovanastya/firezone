Once you have successfully installed Firezone you'll need to add users to grant them access to your network. This is done through the Web UI.

### Web UI
Add a user by clicking the "Add User" button under `/users`. You will be asked to specify an email and a password for the user. These credentials will be used to authenticate the user so they are able to establish the connection.

Next, [add devices](/docs/user-guides/add-devices.md) to the user.
