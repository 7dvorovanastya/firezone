# Security Policy

We appreciate your help in making Firezone secure! We take security issues very
seriously and strive to fix all security issues as soon as they're reported.

## Announcements

We'll announce major security issues on our security mailing list located at:

https://discourse.firez.one

## Supported Versions

We release security patches for supported versions of Firezone. We recommend
running the latest version of Firezone at all times.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open a Github Issue for security issues you encounter.
Instead, please send an email to `security AT firez.one` describing the issue
and we'll respond as soon as possible.
